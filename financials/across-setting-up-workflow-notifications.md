title: Setting Up Workflow Notifications | Microsoft Docs
description: Many workflow responses are about notifying a user that an event has occurred that they must act on. For example, on one workflow step, the event can be that User 1 requests approval of a new record, and the response is that a notification is sent to User 2, the approver. On the next workflow step, the event can be that User 2 approves the record, and the response is that a notification is sent to User 3 to start a related processing of the approved record. For workflow steps that are about approval, each notification is tied to an approval entry.
